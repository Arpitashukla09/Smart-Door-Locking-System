## Smart Door Locking System
This project presents a sophisticated password-protected door locking mechanism designed with an Arduino Nano and a 4x4 matrix keypad. It ensures secure access by unlocking the door upon the entry of a correct password.

## Features
Secure Password Protection: The system unlocks exclusively with the correct password.
Automated Locking: The door locks automatically after a two-second delay.
Password Modification: Users can easily change passwords for enhanced security.
Future Enhancements: Opportunities for integration with remote access, fingerprint recognition, and IoT-based monitoring.

## Technologies Used
1. Arduino Nano
2. Servo Motor
3. 4x4 Matrix Keypad Membrane
4. 9V Battery
5. Connecting Wires

## Instructions for Use
1. Power the System: Connect and power the Arduino setup.
2. Input Password: Enter the default password using the keypad.
3. Unlock Mechanism: The door will unlock upon the entry of the correct password.
4. Automatic Locking: The system will automatically re-lock the door after a delay of two seconds.

## Future Prospects
1. Remote Monitoring: Implement IoT solutions for remote access and oversight.
2. Fingerprint Authentication: Enhance security protocols with fingerprint scanning technology.
3. Safety Integration: Incorporate fire and gas sensors to ensure comprehensive safety.
